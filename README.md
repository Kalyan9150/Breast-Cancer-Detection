# Breast-Cancer-Detection
An affordable and precise way to identify breast
 cancer is through Mammography. It has significantly decreased
 mortality by detecting malignancies early and is essential for
 early detection. It has also increased survival rates. However,
 disparities in mammography access are still mostly driven by
 socioeconomic factors. Ongoing research aims to address these
 problems, improve screening methods, and raise the precision
 and usability of mammography. Additionally, radiologists are
 being assisted by computer-aided detection (CAD) and artificial
 intelligence (AI), which are being used to improve diagnostic
 accuracy. The goal of this research is to identify the best AI
 algorithms for breast cancer detection. We employ a range of pre
processing methods in this study, first resizing the images to see
 which method cleans up our data the best. After segmenting our
 images to locate the region of interest, we extract features using
 a local binary pattern. Numerous classification models have been
 employed, such as SVM, KNN, Random Forest, and Decision
 Tree. Moreover, CNN and RCN have been used for the same
 objective. Furthermore, it was shown that, generally speaking,
 neural networks outperformed classification.
